# Dewey DeciBEL

Dewwey DeciBEL (DD) is a vibe based music randomizer. The idea is to build deposites 
of music. From there you can choose to skip to the next song as normal, or to the 
next deposite. These chunks are defined in different ways to build a vibe. Examples 
include genre, BPM, era, album (plays sequentially), or something else. This 
operates off mp3 meta tags, so missing or inacurate info will reduce functionality.
